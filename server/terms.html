      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 20, 2025</p>
      <div class="terms-notice">
        PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AS THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION REMEDIES.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="terms-content">
      <p>These Terms of Service (these "Terms") form a binding legal agreement between Daps Sports, Inc. ("we", "us", or "our") and you regarding the use of the Daps mobile app(s), website, platform, and related offerings and services (collectively, the "Platform").</p>

      <p>By registering an account or otherwise accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms. We may update these Terms from time to time in our discretion. We will always keep the current version of these Terms posted on this website. By using the Platform after a new version of these Terms have been posted, you agree to the terms and conditions of such version of these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately cease your use of the Platform.</p>

      <p>The Platform is intended to facilitate connections between professional or amateur athletes and sports figures ("Athletes") and fans and other users (collectively, "Fans"). The Platform lets Fans make bids to purchase a collectible (for example, a game-worn jersey or autographed item) (a "Collectible") or one-off digital and/or in-person experiences (for example, social media shout-outs, video calls, meeting after a game) (an "Experience") or co. from Athletes. Collectibles and Experiences are both referred to in these Terms as "Transactions".</p>

      <h2>Payment</h2>
      <p>The price for each Collectible or Experience purchased from an Athlete will be determined by the Athlete accepting the Fan's bid amount. Fans will not be charged unless an Athlete accepts their bid. When you place a bid, you are committing to purchase the Collectible or Experience as soon as the Athlete accepts your bid.</p>

      <p>In order to allow us to operate the Platform, we charge a fixed or percentage-based fee for each Transaction, along with any other fees described on the Platform (collectively, the "Fees"). Our Fees are withheld from the applicable payment made to the Athlete.</p>

      <p>By providing us a payment card or other payment method information, you authorize us to automatically charge you for the designated amount should your bid be accepted by an Athlete.</p>

      <p>You acknowledge and agree that we may use one or more third-party payment processors to facilitate payments made through the Platform, and that such payment processors will receive sufficient information regarding you and your payment method as needed to process such payments. We may impose a reasonable hold period on paid amounts, for funding confirmation and anti-fraud purposes. All payments are non-refundable unless otherwise expressly stated.</p>

      <p>The Fees are exclusive of taxes, and any taxes incurred by us based on our provision of the Platform or processing of any Transactions will be charged to Fans in addition to the Fees. Athletes are responsible for any taxes they may incur in connection with their use of the Platform or amounts received in connection with such use.</p>

      <p>We will pay Athletes amounts received from Fans for applicable Transactions, less our Fees and any third-party processing fees and charges (for example, charges we incur from our payment processor to transfer payment to the Athlete). We will make such payments in arrears.</p>

      <p>We may hold payments for Collectibles and Experiences until the applicable Athlete and/or Fan have confirmed the Collectible was delivered or the Experience was completed. We may process a refund if a Collectible is not delivered or an Experience has not been completed within a reasonable period of time, or if the Athlete cancels the Experience or is unable to ship the Collectible. If the Athlete and Fan disagree over whether the Collectible was delivered or the Experience was completed: (i) we may seek to facilitate a resolution but are under no obligation to do so; and (ii) we may in our discretion choose to either refund the amounts paid by the Fan and/or pay the applicable amount to the Athlete (or allow the Athlete to retain amounts paid); and (iii) you agree that if you have any further dispute with the counterparty to such Transaction (either the Fan or the Athlete, as applicable) your claim is against them, not us.</p>

      <h2>Acknowledgments and Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>You agree and acknowledge the following:</p>

      <p><strong>Information and Accounts:</strong> You will be required to provide certain information (including personal information) to register your account on the Platform, and you will be required to provide additional information, including payment information, to complete a Transaction. You are responsible for ensuring you provide complete and accurate information and keep such information up to date, and you are responsible for any liability or damages arising from false, fraudulent, or incomplete information. Such information may be shared as described in our privacy policy. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and your login credentials, and you will be responsible for any actions taken using your account credentials. Even though we may endeavor to provide you with reasonable records or receipts of your transactions, you are ultimately responsible for keeping your own records and making appropriate backups – we will not be responsible for any loss of data in our possession or control.</p>

      <p><strong>Transactions:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old (or the applicable age of majority in your legal jurisdiction) to enter into any Transactions. Parents or legal guardians may use the Platform on behalf of a child under such age. You are responsible for Transactions you enter into, including: (i) identifying an appropriate Athlete or Fan to work with; (ii) negotiating and clearly defining the agreed scope of the Transaction (e.g., what services or deliverables are expected and the amount and timing of payment); and (iii) fulfilling your obligations under any Transaction you have entered into. You are solely responsible for selecting the Athletes or Fans you wish to work with – we provide a platform to facilitate these connections, but do not endorse any Athletes or Fans. WE ARE NOT PARTY TO ANY TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO WITH ANY ATHLETE OR FAN, AND WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ATHLETE'S OR FAN'S FULFILLMENT OF ANY TRANSACTION.</p>

      <p><strong>Electronic Signatures:</strong> You consent to the use of electronic signatures in connection with the Platform, including your acceptance of these Terms and our other policies and the entry into any Transactions through the Platform. Your electronic signature (which may include checking boxes, clicking "I accept", spelling out your name, or otherwise taking actions intended to indicate acceptance) will be as valid and binding as a handwritten signature.</p>

      <p><strong>Compliance:</strong> You are responsible for your own compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you are responsible for compliance with: (i) any rules or policies promulgated by applicable institutions, including without limitation the Athlete's educational institution, athletic conference, the NCAA, or any similar governing bodies; and (ii) advertising, sponsorship, and consumer protection rules and guidelines promulgated by the FTC or any other governing body.</p>

      <h2>Community Standards</h2>
      <p>We are not responsible for the conduct of any Platform users. You will act in a professional, respectful, ethical, and lawful manner when using the Platform. Without limiting the foregoing, you represent, warrant, and agree that you will not, directly or indirectly: (i) remove any trademark or copyright notices or watermarks contained in the Platform or any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, or other material or content that are displayed, used, or otherwise incorporated into the Platform (collectively, "Content"); (ii) reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, transmit, disseminate, transfer, license, sell, lease, create derivative works based upon, or in any way commercially exploit the Platform or Content outside of the Platform, including seeking to extract or copy any Content (other than sharing it through the Platform's built-in sharing functionality, if any); (iii) use manual or automated means to trawl, mine, scrape, frame, or mirror the Platform or Content; (iv) disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Platform or Content; (v) attempt to hack, defeat, or overcome any encryption technology or security measures regarding the Platform or our other systems or those of any third party, or gain any unauthorized access to any systems or accounts; (vi) interfere with or disrupt the operation of the Platform or any other systems or otherwise interrupt or interfere with any other user's use or enjoyment of the Platform; (vii) promote illegal activity or violate any applicable local, state, national or international law; (viii) post or transmit any Content, submit any request, or otherwise behave in any manner, that is discriminatory, unlawful, defamatory, abusive, harassing, threatening, indecent, pornographic, obscene, fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate or infringes any intellectual property or privacy or other rights of any person; (ix) send unsolicited advertisements; (x) impersonate any person or misrepresent your identity or affiliation; (xi) use the Platform in a way that is not for its intended purposes or that will adversely affect us or reflect negatively on us, any of our goodwill, name or reputation; (xii) provide any false or misleading information or any information that you do not have the right to provide; or (xiii) otherwise violate any of our published rules, policies, or guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Content; Ownership and License</h2>
