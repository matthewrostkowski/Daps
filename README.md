# Daps

Daps is a Node/Express + Prisma backend with pages for admin, user, offers, and more. The server exposes JSON APIs (e.g., `/api/athletes`, `/api/users/*`) and serves static assets from `public/`.
Frontend pages live in `server/` (`admin.html`, `index.html`, `my-offers.html`, `user.html`, etc).

---

## üß† Features of Daps

* **Account Management** ‚Äì Users can create, verify, and log into accounts securely using JWT-based authentication and email verification (`user.html`).
* **Offer Submissions** ‚Äì Fans can make offers on athlete experiences directly through the UI, specifying bid amounts, event types, and descriptions.
* **Offer Tracking Dashboard** ‚Äì The ‚ÄúMy Offers‚Äù page displays offer history with filtering (Pending, Approved, Declined), dynamic rendering, and timestamping (`my-offers.html`).
* **Admin Panel** ‚Äì Admins can approve or reject offers, manage athlete profiles, and send templated emails directly from the dashboard (`admin.html`).
* **Automated Notifications** ‚Äì Email updates are sent automatically for account verification, password resets, and offer status changes (`email.js`).
* **Logging and Debugging** ‚Äì All backend actions log cleanly to the console (API requests, SMTP verification, server routing, offer updates) with consistent formatting for tracing and debugging (`app.js`).

---

## üë§ User Flow

1. **Landing Page (`index.html`)** ‚Äì Users browse active athletes and game-day experiences and select one to make an offer.
2. **Sign Up / Login (`user.html`)** ‚Äì Users create accounts with email verification; JWTs are stored locally for secure sessions.
3. **Submit Offer** ‚Äì Logged-in users can submit offers tied to specific athletes and experiences.
4. **View My Offers (`my-offers.html`)** ‚Äì Users view all offers with their statuses (Pending/Approved/Declined) in an interactive dashboard.
5. **Admin Portal (`admin.html`)** ‚Äì Admin logs in securely to manage athletes, review offers, and send approval/decline emails directly.
6. **Automated Communication** ‚Äì `email.js` handles verification and offer updates automatically through Nodemailer integration.

## Tech stack

* Node 18+ / Express, CORS, JWT auth, Nodemailer, Prisma client.
* Static assets served via Express + `public/`.

---

## 1) Prerequisites

* **Node** v18+ and **npm**
* **PostgreSQL** running locally (or remote)
* **Git** access to this repo

---

## 2) Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org-or-user>/Daps.git
cd Daps
```

---

## 3) Environment variables (copy & fill)

Create the server runtime env from the example template:

```bash
# from repo root:
cp .env.example server/.env
```

Required vars (fill with real values):

* **PORT** (default 5175) ‚Äì optional
* **DATABASE_URL** ‚Äì Postgres connection string (for Prisma)
* **SESSION_SECRET** ‚Äì JWT signing secret for user sessions
* **SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, EMAIL_FROM** ‚Äì for transactional email
* **PUBLIC_BASE_URL** ‚Äì public URL used in verification/reset links

> Never commit `server/.env`. Only the placeholder `.env.example` is tracked.

---

## 4) Install & DB setup

```bash
cd server
npm ci
# bring schema to the DB (use one of the following depending on your setup)
npx prisma migrate deploy || npx prisma db push
```

(Optional) Seed starter data if needed:

```bash
node src/seed-athletes.js
```

(If there‚Äôs an npm script, you can use `npm run seed` instead.)

---

## 5) Run the server

```bash
# inside /server
npm run dev   # if defined
# otherwise:
node src/app.js
```

The API will start on `http://localhost:5175` (unless you set `PORT`). Static assets are served from `/public`, and `/images` is mapped (with a tiny 1√ó1 fallback to avoid 404 spam).

**Key endpoints**

* `GET /api/athletes` and `GET /api/users/athletes` ‚Äì list athletes
* `POST /api/users/login` ‚Äì returns a JWT on success. Use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for protected routes
* `GET /api/users/me` ‚Äì example protected route

**Static pages**

* `server/index.html`, `server/my-offers.html`, `server/user.html`, `server/admin.html` can be opened directly or served via a static server for local testing.

---

## 6) Email (development)

On boot or when sending mail, the app creates/verifies a Nodemailer SMTP transport using your env vars. If SMTP isn‚Äôt configured, verification will fail but the server can still run; set real SMTP to test verification and password-reset flows.

---

## 7) Auth model (quick note)

User sessions are JWTs signed with `SESSION_SECRET`. Protected routes expect `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. If the token is missing/invalid, the server returns 401.

---

## 8) Common tasks

```bash
# lint (if configured)
npm run lint

# run tests (if any)
npm test
```

---

## 9) Security & operational hygiene

* **Secrets:** keep all credentials in `server/.env`. Only `.env.example` is committed.
* **Logs:** request logging is enabled (method, path, body for write ops). Avoid logging secrets in routes.
* **Images:** `/images/placeholder.jpg` has a tiny fallback to prevent noisy 404 loops.
* **Do not commit:** `server/node_modules/` or `server/cookies.txt`‚Äîthey‚Äôre local artifacts. (See `file_structure.txt`.)

---

## 10) AI

AI assistance was used to:

* **Normalize formatting** and **add inline comments** for clarity and maintainability.
* **Harden logging and error messages** for debugging without exposing sensitive data.
* **Refactor small utilities** (e.g., image fallback, auth helpers) with human review for accuracy and security.
* **Generate boilerplate routes and emails**, edited for correctness (JWT, SMTP).
* **Standardize variable naming** and documentation style across modules.
* **Write this README.**

---

## 11) Troubleshooting

* **401 on protected routes** ‚Üí ensure you‚Äôre sending `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from `/api/users/login`.
* **Email not sending** ‚Üí verify SMTP credentials and app passwords.
* **Images 404 spam** ‚Üí placeholder handling is intentional; ensure your `public/images` paths are valid.
